#### English: Labelled by a language expert
#### Haitian Creole: MTurk with 5 annotators

Task: The sentences that are given to you are tweets collected during natural disasters. Some of them are people requesting for assistance and some are just reports. Your task is to select phrases that support one of the 5 following types of requests. If there is nothing to label, click “no entities to label” and submit.

1) medical_help - eg: 'need medical assistance'

2) water - eg: 'really thirsty, need water'

3) food - eg: 'hungry, need food'

4) shelter - eg: 'need tents'

5) other_aid - eg: 'provide us with a boat'

6th option is to select nothing when the sentence contains none of the above.


### Example: Water

Direct Mention: “Please help us, we need water”. Here “need water” is the phrase we are looking for.

Indirect Mention: “Please help us, we are thirsty”. Here the help is needed because they are thirsty. So it is very likely that they need water. So label “thirsty”.

Incorrect: “My basement is flooded with water”. Here “water” is not a resource. So don’t label anything. In such cases, simply click “no entities to label” and submit.
